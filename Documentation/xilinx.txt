    openPOWERLINK on Xilinx Microblaze for IEK (LX150T) and MicroBoard (LX9)
    =========================================================================

1 Introduction
---------------

  This file contains documentation for the openPOWERLINK stack on Xilinx
  Microblaze. It uses the POWERLINK IP-Core which consists of a optimized MAC
  for POWERLINK (openMAC) and a hub for daisy chaining several controlled nodes.

  The demos and IP-Cores are available for the PLB and AXI bus system.


Contents
---------

- FPGA design with Microblaze CPU and POWERLINK IP-Core.
- Latched I/0 Ports: 4 x 8Bit - plus latch signal.
  Direction (input or output) can be defined by configuration-pin level.

Performance Data
-----------------

- Minimum cycle length: 400 µs
- PReq-PRes Latency: 1 µs
- Process data: 4 bytes input and 4 bytes output.
- There is 1 RPDOs and 1 TPDO available. Cross-traffic is disabled.


Requirements
-------------

- Development Board Industrial Ethernet Kit (IEK, LX150T) with an
  ISMET FMC module or the Microbloard (micro, LX9).

- Xilinx Platform Cable USB II for JTAG programming (or similar).

- Xilinx ISE Design Suite 13.2 (Embedded Edition).

- Experiences with this development environment is required.

- POWERLINK network as described in main readme.txt.
  or alternatively a POWERLINK network with Configuration Manager.
  The corresponding XDD for this node can be found in the subdirectory
  ObjDicts\CiA401_CN of the openPOWERLINK main directory.

    d. Install jumper on JP4 & JP9.

2. Setup for the Microboard (micro, LX9)
    a. Download the user guide for the board from:
       http://www.em.avnet.com/en-us/design/drc/Pages/Xilinx-Spartan-6-FPGA-LX9-MicroBoard.aspx
    b. Connect the Xilinx Platform Cable USB II to J6 and to the USB port of
       your PC.
    c. Connect the USB cable to J3 and to the USB port of your PC.
    d. Connect the Ethernet jack in J1 to the Ethernet port of your PC.

How to build the binaries
---------------------------

1. Open the Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) and set the 'Global Repository Search
   Path' to the POWERLINK IP-Core (ipcore/xilinx) directory.
   (Note: There is no need to open a project!)

   Edit -> Preferences -> Application -> Global Peripheral Repository Search
   Path (e.g: $STACK_ROOT/Examples/ipcore/xilinx)

2. Open 'ISE Design Suite [64,32] Bit Command Prompt' depending on your
   platform.

3. Go to this subdirectory of openPOWERLINK:

    $ cd Examples/xilinx_microblaze/no_os/gnu/demo_cn_digitalio

4. Edit the following parameters in file makefile.settings:
   XPS_DIR=../../../[avnet_lx150t,avnet_lx9]/design_microblaze_directIO-[plb,axi]
   BOARD_NAME=[lx150t,lx9]
   BUS_INTERFACE=[plb,axi]

5. Run 'make all' to generate the bitstream and build the ELF file
  (directIO.elf).

    $ make all

6. If you want to change to an other design please do a clean after changing
   the makefile.settings variables.

    $ make clean


How to run the demo
--------------------

1. Setup the POWERLINK network as described in main readme.txt located in
   openPOWERLINK main directory.

2. Run 'make download-bits' to download the bitstream to the target.

    $ make download-bits

3. Run 'make download-elf' to download the software to the target.

    $ make download-elf

4. Use a terminal program to see the debug output
    a. Baud rate: 9600
    b. Data Bits: 8
    c. Stop Bits: 1
    d. Parity: none
    e. Flow control: none


5. Have fun with openPOWERLINK on Xilinx!


How to import the project into the SDK for debugging purposes
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the Xilinx Software Development Kit (SDK).

2. Import the 'demo_directIO' into the SDK by using
   Import -> General -> Existing Project into Workspace

   Select the project 'demo_cn_digitalio' in the folder
   $STACK_ROOT/Examples/xilinx_microblaze/no_os/gnu/demo_cn_digitalio for import.

3. Create a new Hardware platform with:
   File -> New -> Xilinx Hardware Platform Specification

   Set the 'Target Hardware Specification' to
   $STACK_ROOT/Examples/xilinx_microblaze/avnet_lx[150t,lx9]/design_microblaze_directIO-[plb,axi]/SDK/SDK_Export/hw

4. Set the Repository Search Path with:

   Xilinx Tools -> Repositories -> Local Repositories
   (e.g: $STACK_ROOT/Examples/ipcore/xilinx)

5. Create a new Board Support Package with:
   File -> New -> Xilinx Board Support Package

   Select the previously created hardware platform as a reference.

6. Change the 'demo_directIO' software project to point to the board support
   package. (Right click on project -> Change referenced BSP).

7. Run -> Debug As -> Lunch on Hardware to start the debugger and step through
   the code.

How to write the program to local flash
-----------------------------------------

In order to write the example to the non volatile memory a bootloader is needed
to read the program from the flash and write it to the external RAM. This
bootloader is provided with the stack in the following folder:
   $STACK_ROOT/Examples/xilinx_microblaze/no_os/gnu/mem_bootloader

The following steps need to be executed in order to write the program to the
local flash:

1. The flash image can be generated by using the gen_flash make target:

    $ make gen_flash

2. This generated .mcs image can be written to the flash by using the prog_flash
   make target:

    $ make prog_flash

   In case of the IEK (lx150t) the application software is not part of the .mcs
   image and needs to be written separately to the local parallel flash.
   For this the 'flash_image_sw.bin' file is generated which consists of the application
   software as a binary format.

   The following additional steps need to be carried out for this board:

   a. Open the Xilinx Software Development Kit (SDK) and import the provided project file.
   b. Create a hardware platform and board support package for your design.
   c. Inside the SDK open the Xilinx Tools -> Flash Programmer and select the
      'flash_image_sw.bin' for download. Select the linear flash and DDR3 memories and use
      program offset 0x00000000 in the configuration window.

Finally your program should be written to non-volatile memory!

Troubleshooting
-----------------

1. It is adviced to clean all generated files after switching from one demo to
   the other.

    $ make clean_all
